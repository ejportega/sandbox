# ðŸ§ª Git Sandbox

Welcome to the playground!

This repository exists purely for experimenting with Git. Use it to try out:
- Branching and merging
- Rebasing and squashing
- Undoing mistakes
- Creating and resolving merge conflicts
- Stashing, tagging, and more

Nothing here is permanent. Break things on purpose and learn by doing.
